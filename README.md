My project involves exploratory data analysis (EDA) on an Amazon Prime dataset.
The goal was to:
Clean and analyze the dataset using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib).
Visualize trends using both Python and Power BI for impactful storytelling.
Gain insights into content distribution, ratings, genres, and more.
Dataset:
I have taken this Dataset from Kaggle which has 9668 Rows and 12 Columns.
Here's what I actually Analysed:
• Count of movies vs TV shows
• Top countries producing Amazon Prime content
• Most common genres
• Year of Release
• Typical length of movies or number of seasons for TV shows
• Identified and handled null or missing values
• Used Python libraries (Pandas,Matplotlib) to visualize trends
• Created Power BI dashboards
